Introduction to Computer Science Projects

This repository contains a collection of small Java programs I built during my **freshman year** in my *Introduction to Computer Science* course.

While these projects are not intended to be advanced or production-ready, they represent the foundation of my programming journey — where I first learned Java syntax, problem-solving, and core computer science concepts.
I’ve kept this repository public as a way to reflect on my growth and progress over time.

Contents

**ArithmeticQuiz.java**
  A console-based arithmetic quiz that generates random math problems, takes user input, and evaluates correctness.

**AuthoringAssistant.java**
  A simple text-processing assistant that counts words, replaces phrases, and formats text based on user input.

**Blackjack.java**
  A simplified, text-based version of the Blackjack card game with basic gameplay rules and score tracking.

**FizzBuzz.java**
  The classic FizzBuzz exercise — prints numbers with substitutions for multiples of 3 and/or 5.

**GPACalculator.java**
  A GPA calculator that takes course grades and credit hours to compute a weighted GPA.

**IntegerSorter.java**
  Reads a list of integers and outputs them in sorted order using basic sorting logic.

Skills Learned

Through building these programs, I practiced:

* **Java basics** — variables, loops, conditionals, functions, and arrays
* **Input/output handling**
* **Basic algorithms** — sorting, searching, and iteration
* **Problem decomposition** — breaking tasks into smaller, manageable steps
* **Early debugging and testing strategies**

Note:
  These projects were created early in my CS journey and intentionally remain unoptimized to preserve their original form.
  They serve as a record of my starting point and a reminder of how far I’ve come as a developer.
